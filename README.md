# 🚀 Habit Tracker & AI-Powered Task Categorizer

This project is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help you track and categorize your Google Tasks using the power of Artificial Intelligence. It integrates with Google Tasks to fetch your daily activities, leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically categorize them, and provides a visual heatmap to help you understand your productivity and habits over time.

## ✨ Motivation

In today's fast-paced world, understanding how we spend our time and what types of tasks dominate our days is crucial for personal growth and productivity. This tool aims to provide insights into your daily habits by:

*   **Automating Task Analysis**: Eliminating the manual effort of categorizing tasks.
*   **Visualizing Activity**: Offering a clear, at-a-glance overview of your work, play, and health activities.
*   **Promoting Self-Awareness**: Helping you identify patterns, balance your efforts, and make informed decisions about your time allocation.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Google Tasks Integration**: Seamlessly connects with your Google Tasks account to retrieve your task lists and individual tasks.
*   **AI-Powered Task Categorization**: Utilizes advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Google Gemini (with optional support for OpenAI models) to automatically classify your tasks into predefined categories (e.g., Work, Play, Health) and assign a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD). This intelligent categorization provides deeper insights into your task load.
*   **Comprehensive CLI Interface**:
    *   `--setup` (`-s`): Guides you through the initial configuration process, including setting up Google API credentials and LLM API keys.
    *   `--list` (`-l`): Displays all your currently tracked Google Task lists and the tasks within them, enriched with AI-generated categories and difficulty.
    *   `--add` (`-a`): Allows you to easily add new Google Task lists to be tracked by the application.
*   **Interactive Activity Heatmap**: Generates a visually engaging HTML heatmap (similar to GitHub contribution graphs) that represents your daily activity. Each day is colored based on the dominant task category and intensity, providing a quick overview of your productivity trends.
*   **Persistent Data Storage**: All categorized task data is securely stored in Google Firebase Firestore, allowing for historical tracking, analysis, and future enhancements.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Backend**: Python
*   **Task Management**: Google Tasks API
*   **Artificial Intelligence**: Google Generative AI (Gemini), OpenAI API (optional)
*   **Database**: Google Firebase Firestore
*   **Authentication**: Google OAuth2
*   **Frontend (Visualization)**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the standalone heatmap)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.x
*   Git
*   A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
*   A Firebase project
*   An API key for Google Gemini (or OpenAI, if preferred)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Skaarfacee/habit.git
    cd habit
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### 🛠️ Project Setup Guide

This section outlines the steps required to configure the Google Tasks API and Firebase Storage for this project. Please follow each part carefully to ensure the system functions correctly.
#### 📌 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Git
- Access to the Google Cloud Console
- Access to Firebase Console

#### 🔧 Setting up Google Tasks API

To enable your app to interact with the Google Tasks API follow the steps below:

##### Go to Google Cloud Console
Navigate to: https://console.cloud.google.com

- Create a New Project

    - Click the project dropdown at the top left
    - Select New Project
    - Name your project and click Create

- Enable the Google Tasks API
    - Within your project, go to APIs & Services > Library
    - Search for Google Tasks API
    - Click Enable

- Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
    - Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
    - Click Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID
    - If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen first:
        - Set User Type to External (unless otherwise required)
        - Fill in required fields (e.g., App name, Support email)
        - Save and continue through the scopes section (no changes needed for now)
        - Add test users if necessary (usually your own email)

        - Then, continue creating credentials:
            > Choose Application Type: Desktop App <br>
            > Name it (e.g., My Tasks Client) <br>
            > Click Create <br>
        Click Download JSON to get your `credentials.json` file

- Save the File
    - Place the downloaded `credentials.json` in the `config ` directory of the project 

#### 🔥 Setting up Firebase Storage

To use Firebase for file storage, follow these steps:

- Go to Firebase Console
    - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com

- Create or Select a Project
    - Click Add Project or select an existing one
    - Follow the prompts to configure the project
- Enable Firebase Storage
    - In the left sidebar, go to Build > Storage
    - Click Get Started and configure rules as needed
    - Wait for the default storage bucket to be set up

- Generate Admin SDK Credentials
    - Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
    - Click Generate New Private Key
    - This will download a `firebase.json` file containing your Firebase Admin SDK credentials
- Save the File
    - Place this `firebase.json` in the `config` directory

#### **LLM API Key Setup**:

*   Add your Gemini API key (or OpenAI API key) when prompted while running the app 

#### **Initial Application Setup**:
Run the setup command to initialize the application and authenticate with Google Tasks:
    ```bash
    python main.py --setup
    ```

## 💡 Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

*   **Run the setup wizard**:
    ```bash
    python main.py --setup
    ```
*   **List your tracked Google Task lists and tasks**:
    ```bash
    python main.py --list
    ```
*   **Add a new Google Task list to be tracked**:
    ```bash
    python main.py --add
    ```
    You will be prompted to enter the name of the task list.

### Activity Heatmap (WIP)

The `index.html` file provides a visual heatmap of your categorized activities. This file is currently a standalone visualization. To view your heatmap:

1.  After running the `main.py` script (which processes and saves data to Firebase), you would typically export the processed data into a format consumable by `index.html`.
2.  Open `index.html` directly in your web browser.

*Note: The `index.html` currently contains hardcoded sample data. For real-time visualization, you would need to implement a mechanism to dynamically populate the `DATA` variable in `index.html` with the data from Firebase Firestore.*
